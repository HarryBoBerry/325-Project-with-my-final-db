This database could be used in various ways. It allows you to look up information of your customers and employees.
You can use this to give you the averages of customer reviews and show you which customers are reviewing the most
and what they are reviewing along with their ratings. You could also use this database later on with purchases if
this was ever implemented in the real world. It would allow you to look up their prefered payment method and if 
if you wanted you could even use their email addesss to send coupons or recipets with every purchase. This database is
 also helpful in figuring out which customers are near to 10 stamps which is in the business rules of recieving one
free beer with every 10 stamps. 

It is also possible to see what the actual review is from the customer and it's review id. I think it's important
to keep the cust_id and reivew_id different so if anyone where to use this later the review id could be used
in replacement of using cust_id which contains peronal information. You could use this data base for all sorts of
things. You could use it to collect meta data about who purchases what and eventually create a favorite for that
individual. This database isn't only important to the business owner but it could be used by the customer as well.
It could be useful for a customer to look up either thier own information for knowledge on how many stamps they have
or to look up the review of a food item or beer. reviews of items seem pretty basic but they hold alot of value to 
the consumer and the owner. The owner could use this information to decided what products they should by next based
on the ratings that it recieved. Overall, this database could be implimented to a the business it's meant for
very easily and with the addition of a simple purchase table you could get even more data about what and why
certain things are more popular than another.

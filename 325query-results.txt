(Join) Displaying first and last name of customer with their review_id's. Helps show who is reviewing
the most and how many times they have done it. If you wanted you could add an aggregate function to
show exactly how many reviews a certain person has done. But since the amount of customer's with reviews
is so small I didnt feel it neccesary.

Aggregate function. This helps display what beers are above the average. This isn't too helpful in terms of
owner use but if you where a customer I think this could be very helpful. It could assist you with
helping you choose a beer that isn't too cheap but not the absolute most expenisve. Moderate spenders
would appreciate this

Normally I taste an IPA and I am shocked when I see that the brewer took time to
 making something really special. But in this case it was simple and plain. Not

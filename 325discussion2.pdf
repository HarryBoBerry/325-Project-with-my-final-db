This database could be maintained reall easily. You would have to have some type of script written to ensure that
you are able to insert new info on customers and their reviews. If there where to be a new beer or food item
you would have to add those as well. But that is very easy. One thing I thought would interesting is if I added
a sequence to review_id's so that everytime that a review is made it is automatically given a new uniqure primary
key that can be used to identify it and this should also be applied to beer and food items when new ones come in.
Some issues that might arrise is that with a large enough amount of data it could slow down considerably but
since this is mostly just an inventory of current items, their names, and what their reviews are I could see
someone maintaining this database on their own. I would even be able to make it more user friendly so that it
could be easily modified, updated, or deleted without much effort from the owner. 

With that in mind though. I believe that I would give access to the owner to edit and maintain their own database.
I don't believe you would actually need a database administrator until you had multiple locations or 1000's of 
different reviews. If that was the case you would probably need to hire an administrator to make sure that all
the data is backed up and saved so that if for some reason the database crashed and the data was lost. You could
easily recover it through proper backups. I don't feel like a normal person would be able to do this without
it being automatically updated and even than it would be difficult for an automated system to actually do the
job properly. You wouldn't want to loose multiple customer's information. But other than making sure that their
values correlate to the restraints of the insert I don't find any reason why the business owner wouldn't 
be able to maintain it themselves.
